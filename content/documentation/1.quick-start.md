# Quick Start

Flakery creates templates and deployments for your nixos flakes. You can use flakery to create deployments of a nixos flake, seeded with a file system. These files are encrypted at rest and can be decrypted on demand. 

This tutorial will cover deploying a [simple go hello world webserver](https://github.com/r33drichards/go-webserver) on Flakery. It will also cover optionally configuring tailscale to allow you to access your server from anywhere.

### Create your Template using the Flake


Create a new template using the flake you want to deploy. In this case, we will use `github:r33drichards/go-webserver#flakery`.
